# Gamers' Toolkit 2.0 #

## First Steps ##
This project starts as a rebuild of the Gamers' Toolkit iOS app.  Following that, new features will be added and released as 2.0.

## New Features ##
1. Printing/PDF exporting.
1. New game system support (World of Darkness, GURPS, D&D 5, AD&D 2 & 1, D&D original).
1. Cloud service sharing/exporting/importing.
